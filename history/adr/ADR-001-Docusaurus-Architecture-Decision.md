# ADR-001: Docusaurus Architecture Decision

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Drivers**:
  – Constitution mandates Docusaurus v3.9+ with TypeScript strict mode and Tailwind CSS
  – Must support MDX, fast static builds (<60 s), and GitHub Pages deployment
  – Required for future RAG chatbot embedding (Part 2) and i18n (Bonus 4)
- **Context**:
  – We need a documentation framework that supports rich interactive components, executable code badges, and future dynamic bonuses while remaining fully static
- **Options Considered**:
  – Docusaurus v3.9+
  – Next.js + MDX
  – Hugo + AsciiDoctor
  – Sphinx + MyST
- **Decision**:
  – Docusaurus v3.9+ with TypeScript strict mode and Tailwind is the only allowed and chosen platform
- **Consequences**:
  + Excellent MDX + React support, built-in versioning, themes, and plugin ecosystem
  + Perfect GitHub Pages integration and <30 s average build time
  – Slight learning curve for pure documentation teams (mitigated by Claude Code skills)
  + Directly enables Bonus 2–4 integration later
- **Bonus 1 Impact**: Enables reusable React components generated by Claude Code skills
